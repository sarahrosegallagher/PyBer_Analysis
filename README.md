# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis was to use 2019 data to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Leading up to this analysis, I created several different types of graphs while exploring the data (box and whisker plots, pie charts, scatter bubble charts, bar charts including error bars) and created various groupings to inform the final analysis. These additional graphs and investigation can be found in the Additional Exercises folder and Initial_Analysis.ipynb, while the final analysis can be found in PyBer_Analysis.ipynb
